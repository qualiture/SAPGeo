# SAPGeo - Build a geofencing app

This is the resulting Xcode project for the **How-To tutorial** [Build a geofencing app](https://www.sap.com/developer/how-tos/2017/07/fiori-ios-scpms-geolocation.html) using **SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS**.

If you clone this project, make sure you add the [SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS](https://store.sap.com/sap/cpa/ui/resources/store/html/SolutionDetails.html?pid=0000014485) `SAPzzzzz.framework` files yourself. Also, you need to enter your own SAP Cloud Platform URL into `Constants.swift`.

The SAP HANA MDC scripts are not included, those are listed in the tutorial.
